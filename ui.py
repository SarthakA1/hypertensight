   st.write("Diagnosing hypertensive retinopathy (HR) is fraught with challenges primarily due to the absence of efficient diagnostic methods, which hampers early detection and treatment effectiveness. HR, a complication of hypertension affecting the retina, poses a risk of irreversible blindness if not promptly managed. Current estimates indicate that even though the percentage varies by demographic groups, 2-17% people with hypertension and no comorbidities are expected to be diagnosed with hypertensive retinopathy. This translates to about 22.6 million to 198.88 million people worldwide. Simply put, out of all people in the world, approximately 0.283% - 2.486% have HR. The conventional approach to diagnosing HR involves manual examination of fundus images to identify subtle disease markers, a process prone to human error and time-intensive evaluations, especially in detecting early-stage symptoms. This delay in detection often results in advanced disease progression by the time symptoms become evident, compromising treatment efficacy. Moreover, the manual review process contributes to significant image review backlogs, prolonging the time to diagnosis and treatment initiation.")

    st.write("Our solution, Hypertensight, is the first autonomous AI system designed for early detection and diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy from retinal images. Integrated into ophthalmological practices, Hypertensight uses advanced AI technologies to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of detection, even in early stages. By delivering rapid automated diagnostic reports, Hypertensight provides timely insights for healthcare providers, facilitating prompt intervention to mitigate vision loss risk. Employing a sophisticated AI-driven methodology, Hypertensight enhances digital retinal images through a meticulous process including image resizing, green channel extraction, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Powered by YOLO v8, a robust Convolutional Neural Network trained on extensive datasets, Hypertensight excels in identifying subtle indicators of hypertensive retinopathy with high sensitivity and specificity. Healthcare providers receive immediate feedback and automated reports summarizing findings and severity assessments based on clinical scales. This streamlined process enhances diagnostic precision and empowers clinicians to optimize patient care promptly, potentially improving outcomes for hypertensive individuals at risk of vision impairment.")

    1. **Capture Fundus Image:**
    Use a high-quality, in-lab fundus camera to capture an image of the patient's retina under optimal lighting conditions.
    
    2. **Save and Upload Image:**
    Save the captured image and upload it to Hypertensight.
    
    3. **Generate Analysis:**
    Click on "Analyze and Generate Report" to obtain an analysis report.

    - Please ensure that images are taken with a high-quality functional fundus camera.
    - Ensure that the pictures are captured under optimal lighting conditions and are saved in an appropriate aspect ratio (at least 224x224 pixels) with high quality.
    - Images sourced from the internet often have low quality and inappropriate aspect ratios, potentially rendering them unsuitable for accurate analysis.
    - We only request the patient's name to generate the report. We do not have access to any databases storing personal information, including patient names or images of their eyes, to ensure privacy.
